I have been in,

uh, a movie and been an actor

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:40.582
with the great
Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.

01:03:40.649 --> 01:03:41.984

I went to go see it.
- Okay.

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.688
- Great movie.
- You know, I'm not saying

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:47.590
I was the best
of the three of us...

01:03:47.656 --> 01:03:49.391

- I hope not.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:53.529
- But, I mean, I did my thing.

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:56.699
I mean, do you guys
remember my scene at all?

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:59.768
- I remember
you were the skateboard pimp.

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:02.004
- But what I did
is I played dead.

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:03.538
I played dead.

01:04:03.605 --> 01:04:07.243
I closed my eyes
and acted dead,

01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:10.679
and Robert De Niro
and Al Pacino would talk.

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:12.181
They would run their scenes,

01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:14.349
and I was playing dead.
- Okay.

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:15.885
- So they would--
I would lay down.

01:04:15.951 --> 01:04:18.787
They would read their lines,
'cause I was, you know,

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:20.223
a dead pimp.

01:04:24.593 --> 01:04:26.495
Yo, look,
every step of the way,

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:28.864
all the way to the skate
scenes to where, like,

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:32.068
I'm, you know,
manhandling the prostitute...

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.439
You know, I'd do, like,
a trick, off of, like, a ledge,

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:39.574
and then I come in,
"You give me my money, bitch."

01:04:39.641 --> 01:04:40.776
You know, whatever it was.

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:43.745
Like, it's [bleep]
so nuts, man.

01:04:43.812 --> 01:04:45.213
Then I get shot, you know.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.982
Anyway, anyway...

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:49.651
But, of course, I never
went on to do any other acting.

01:04:49.718 --> 01:04:52.755
So I can hold my head high
that I'm one of the greatest

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:54.490
