00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:05.710


00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.270
The Arrhenius theory of acids and bases defines

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:15.190
an acid as a substance that releases H+ ions
in solution, and a base as a substance that

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.680
releases OH- ions in solution.
We know that ammonia, NH3, can act as a base

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.680
and exhibits alkaline properties, but contains
no OH- ions. How is this possible?

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.590
In this lesson, we will learn about the Bronsted-Lowry
theory of acids and bases, which fills in

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.329
the gaps in the Arrhenius theory.
Knowledge Core

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.370
You have learned that acids are substances
with a pH lower than 7.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.370
We can test for acids using universal indicator
solution or paper, which turns red or orange,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.670
all depending on the strength of the acid.
Blue litmus paper also turns red in the presence

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.899
of an acid.
An example of an acid that you are likely

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.759
familiar with is hydrochloric acid.
Hydrogen chloride dissolves in water to give

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.729
hydrochloric acid.
Hydrogen chloride will dissociate to give

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.889
a H+ ion and a Cl- ion.
HCl --&gt; H+ and Cl-

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:22.429
The H+ ion is not just &#39;released&#39;, but it
is transferred to another substance.

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.450
HCl(g) + H2O(l) --&gt; H3O+(aq) + Cl-(aq)
For our example, water accepts the H+ ion

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.450
to form a hydronium ion, H3O+.
It is also known as an oxonium ion.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:44.639
A Bronsted-Lowry acid is a substance that
releases or donates H+ ions in solution, in

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:49.990
our case, HCl.
A Bronsted-Lowry base is a substance that

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.789
accepts H+ ions in solution, in our case,
H2O.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.789
Notice that the definition of a Bronsted-Lowry
acid or base is not a function of pH.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.789
So an acid-base reaction, according to the
Bronsted-Lowry theory, involves the transfer

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.640
of a H+ ion from one substance to another.
In the introduction, we mentioned that ammonia

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.420
acts as a base even though it does not release
OH- ions, which is stipulated in the Arrhenius

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.420
theory.
When ammonia dissolves in water, it accepts

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.610
a H+ ion from water.
NH3(g) + H2O(l) --&gt; NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq)

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.010
Notice that this reaction also involves a
H+ ion transfer.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.130
Can you figure out which substance is acting
as an acid in this example? Which is acting

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.680
as a base?
Please pause the lesson to think about this,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.680
and resume when you are ready.
In this example, water acts as a Bronsted-Lowry

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.680
acid because it releases a H+ ion.
Ammonia acts as a Bronsted-Lowry base because

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.370
it accepts a H+ ion.
A base, according to the Bronsted-Lowry theory,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.210
does not need to have a pH greater than 7
or turn red litmus paper blue, or turn universal

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.200
indicator solution or paper blue or purple.
The only requirement is that it is able to

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.270
accept H+ ions.
Have you noticed that H2O acted as a base

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.720
in our first example but as an acid in the
second example?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.830
Substances that can act as either an acid
or a base are amphoteric.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.580
An easy way to remember this term is to recall
that frogs are amphibians Ð they live on

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.830
land and water.
Final Summary

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.760
In conclusion, according to the Bronsted-Lowry
theory, an acid is a substance that dissociates

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.030
to release or donate H+ ions.
A Bronsted-Lowry base is a substance that

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.480
accepts H+ ions.
Therefore, an acid-base reaction, according

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.819
to this theory, involves the transfer of a
proton.
